# MyVanillaJs
This is a simple single page application that used native javascript, html and material css.
to perform task addition,deletion and filtration of tasks.

# Why?
Just inspired with how we can no longer need jquery to perform some of stuffs we used to do with jquery
like DOM manipulation, but insted we can just do with modern ES6 JavaScript

# How to run Locally
after starting a local server run the url http://localhost/myvanillajs
